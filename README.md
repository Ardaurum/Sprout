Engine based on Cherno's great engine series with additional extensions.

Original Cherno's engine series can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT

The goal of this engine is to learn engine programming with focus on the rendering part. Currently only OpenGL and D3D11 is implemented.
