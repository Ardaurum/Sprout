# Sprout

Personal Toy Engine to test ideas and new rendering features. Focused on Windows and DX12/Vulkan.

The project basic setup is based on the Cherno's engine Hazel: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel

The goal of this engine is to learn engine programming with focus on the rendering part. Currently only D3D11 is implemented.
